			<p>There is no species of Albatross called the Albatrump.</p>
			<p>But there are 21 species of albatross, including the Wandering Albatross which has a wing span of up to 11'. Just to put that into perspective, the tallest basketball player in the NBA is 7'7''.</p>

		<h2>Actual Albatross Information</h2>
		<div class="true-fact-one">
			<p>Sure, you probably knew the Albatross mates for life. But did you know they aren’t always monogamous? Both males and females “sleep around”. That doesn’t seem to affect the pair’s bond as they still stay committed and raise a chick together each breeding season. Pair bonds are not formed willy nilly; it can take over a year to raise an albatross chick, a serious commitment requiring a reliable partner.</p>
			<p>When an albatross reaches sexual maturity, it will fly to a breeding colony, but not to mate. It’s going there to practice “dancing”. The young albatross will rehearse their moves for a few years, learning what works and what doesn’t. They are born knowing the right behaviors but they don’t know how to read or respond to other birds. It takes practice to get it right. Sound familiar?</p>
			<p>After practicing for a few years, albatrosses will start to dance for fewer and fewer birds, eventually picking a single partner. Partners will then continue to practice together creating a dance that is totally unique to them. No other Albatross pair will dance the same.</p>
		</div><!-- /true-fact-one -->
		<div class="true-fact-two">
			
			<p>Guess who threatens Albatrosses? Yup, humans sure do. Overfishing has depleted food sources and hooks from long line fishing will often be ingested and drown the birds.</p>
			<p>But feral cats and rats are also a big problem for the albatross. They get introduced to the remote islands where albatrosses breed and then hunt the albatross chicks and destroy the their eggs. </p>
			<p>Tiger Sharks are another challenge for the albatross. They gather off the shores of the breeding colonies and prey on the young birds who are just learning to fly. That’s right, two of the albatross’s biggest problems are cats and tiger sharks. What else brings sharks and cats together?</p>
